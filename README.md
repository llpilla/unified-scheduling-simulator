# unified-scheduling-simulator: library to test scheduling algorithms

## Dependencies

- python (currently tested on version 3.6)
- python-numpy (to generate different distributions and to use statistical functions)
- python-scipy (to use statistical functions)
- python-matplotlib (to generate figures)

## How to run examples

In the base folder, run `source ./configure.sh` to update `PYTHONPATH`. 
You can then easily call any of the example scripts (for instance, `python3 example/report.py`).
